# Releases and tags

- No version tags for routine releases; do not create `v*` tags here. An image is published by dispatching `docker-build.yaml` on the default branch `latest` (`gh workflow run docker-build.yaml --ref latest`), only when the owner asks. Every workflow is manual-only because CI costs money.
- The image tag derives from the dispatched ref: `latest` comes from branch `latest`, any other branch publishes under its own branch name, so publish from `latest` only.
